# CPLN 680 Capstone Project
by Rui Jiang :information_desk_person:

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Although it was named River of the Year for 2020 and serves fifteen million people for drinking, fishing, kayaking, and other recreation, there is still a 27-mile stretch of the Delaware River between Philadelphia, PA, Camden, NJ, and Chester, PA that needs improvement. This stretch is considered safe for only secondary contact recreation for all time, which means immersion and ingestion, and any high degree of body contact with the water might be dangerous for people. Many projects are currently working on this improvement. They are trying to detect the pollution source, finding the relations between CSOs, precipitation, and water quality. This project is trying to find the potential for waterfront recreation under the current situation and help adjacent communities be informed on the fairest opportunities to access recreational activities for each resident in the safest possible way.
